\subsubsection{Prescribing internal velocity constraints with ASCII files}
\label{sec:prescribed-velocities-ascii-data}
\textit{This section was contributed by Bob Myhill}

Building on \ref{sec:prescribed-velocities}, the \url{cookbooks/prescribed_velocity_ascii_data}
directory contains a plugin which uses an ASCII data file to specify where to prescribe
internal velocities. Velocities are prescribed wherever the field value indicated by the ASCII data file
is greater than 0.5. As before, the plugin is loaded in parameter files as an additional shared library:
\lstinputlisting[language=prmfile]{prescribed_velocity_ascii_data.prm.0.out}

An example parameter file using this plugin can be found at
\url{cookbooks/prescribed_velocity_ascii_data/prescribed_velocity_ascii_data.prm}.
In this file, the velocities are constrained to be zero within the letters ``ASPECT'' (Figure~\ref{fig:prescribed-velocity-ascii-data-init}).
The part of this file which provides the location of the ASCII file and the
prescribed velocity field function is:
\lstinputlisting[language=prmfile]{prescribed_velocity_ascii_data.prm.1.out}
A temperature gradient is applied within the letters, while the temperature field outside the letters is set to be constant.
This initial temperature field is specified by another ASCII data file:
\lstinputlisting[language=prmfile]{prescribed_velocity_ascii_data.prm.2.out}
These two ASCII data files are generated from \texttt{aspect\_name.png} by the python file \texttt{make\_ascii\_files\_from\_png.py},
both of which can be found in the same directory as the parameter file.

During the simulation, excess heat diffuses out from the tops of the letters, and
into the bases of the letters. The temperature gradients in the unconstrained
part of the domain then generate convective flow. Figure~\ref{fig:prescribed-velocity-ascii-data}
illustrates the resulting flow field.
