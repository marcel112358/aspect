New: The DislocationViscosityOutputs now also contain the
diffusion viscosity in addition to the dislocation viscosity
and the boundary area change work fraction. This is useful
to compute the ratio of diffusion and dislocation creep in 
cases where the viscosity is averaged cell-wise, because in
these cases this ratio can not be recovered accurately from
just the dislocation and effective viscosity.
